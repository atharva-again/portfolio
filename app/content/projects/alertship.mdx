# Problem Statement

Electricity and water outages in local neighborhoods often leave residents 
uninformed about the situation and recovery efforts. There is a need for a 
reliable system that allows people to check real-time outages and get timely alerts 
and updates from local authorities.

Moreover, a super app is needed for communities and neighborhoods
to check information like AQI, real-time outage information and alerts
for upcoming ones, and other community-related notifications.

# Solution

I initially tought of AlertShip as a crowdsourced platform (like Where Is My
Train) where users could report the outages they are facing and check for
outage reports submitted by others. I made a web app to demonstrate this idea.

Later, I realized that it is only a matter of time before local authorities
start sending outage alerts and updates to residents in affected areas. So, I 
pivoted the idea to making AlertShip into a super app with all community-related
information at one place.

I even interagted CPCB's air quality data API to show real-time AQI information
for the user's location, but later scrapped it due to time constraints.

# Features

- Auth using Google or Email/Password
- Check real-time electricity and water outage information for your area 
    in a map or list view
- Save your frequent addresses like Home, Office, Study for quick access
    from the user dashboard
- Get notified of upcoming scheduled outages in your area
- Report outages faced by you to help others in your community
- View outage reports submitted by other users in your area

# Architecture

The architecture is pretty simple.

- Frontend: React.js for building the user interface.
- Backend: Firebase for real-time database and authentication.
- Hosting: Vercel Hosting for deploying the web app.
- Next.js for server-side rendering and routing.
- Google Maps API for accurate user location detection.
- Nominatim API for reverse geocoding to get human-readable addresses.

# Learnings

This was my first rode into web dev. I made desings in Figma to imagine how
the web app would look. Worked with React, Next.js, and Firebase first time 
to make AlertShip a reality.

# Future Vision

Though this project is archived now, I would love to get back to it in future
and build it into a full-fledged super app for communities and neighborhoods.

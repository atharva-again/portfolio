# my design philosophy behind this portfolio

import HoverPreviewLink from '../../components/HoverPreviewLink'
import { portfolioHero, pinkSneaker } from '../assets/images'

Since it is my portfolio, I wanted it to reflect my personal style of being minimalist and utilitarian. 
I am not a designer per se, but as they say, beauty lies in the eye of the beholder, and
I consider myself to have a good eye for design.

### why i chose to be more text-heavy than design-heavy?

If I remember correctly, Virgil Abloh once said something along the lines of
"*If you want to sell something for a million, make sure it is kept in a room
worth billion*". 

Now, there's nothing wrong with this philosophy, I myself like
to go to aesthetic expensive cafes once in a while. But, sometimes
there is a huge mismatch between the food and the ambience.
That's what I don't want in my portfolio. 

**I want the content to speak more than the room it is kept in.**
And I want to make sure that you are buying the content, not the room,
which you never actually get.

*PS: Don't hold me on the Virgil Abloh quote, I might be misquoting, but you get the idea.*

### what inspires me and my design philosophy?

I don't like things which have a perceived value much higher than their actual value.
I like things which are functional, utilitarian, and get the job done, 
but without sacrificing aesthetics, user experience, and usability.


I think I can define my design philosophy in three words: Minimalist, Utilitarian, and Beautiful.

### does minimalism mean black and white and boring?

Not for me. I do like other colors, I wear them often too (I have a <HoverPreviewLink href="https://www.myntra.com/casual-shoes/puma/puma-unisex-club-ii-era-sneakers/30035035/buy" className="underline decoration-pink-500 decoration-2 underline-offset-4 transition-colors hover:text-pink-600 dark:hover:text-pink-300" preview={{ title: 'Pink Sneaker', description: 'These are the Puma Club II era.', image: pinkSneaker }}>pink sneaker</HoverPreviewLink> too btw). 
I also like quirky designs, the footer is the evidence.

Since this is a very initial version, I kept the color palette simple
and focused first on shipping with content and good UX.

I am currently pondering over giving the visitor an option 
to choose and design their own theme, but that is for later.

# Problems Faced

No problems faced till now, really.

# Learnings

Worked for the first time with MDX format. It's pretty cool.

# Future Vision

I would be honest, the current design really is pretty simple. 
Might want to cherry pick some cool illustrations and design elements
to add later.

# Why q?

Since I shifted to linux, I have been using and enjoying the
terminal more. I disliked opening ChatGPT or Gemini for quick queries.

Sometimes, I was in the middle of coding or writing something, 
and had a quick query. Opening a browser, going to the site,
waiting for it to load, typing the query, and then getting the answer
took too much time and broke the flow. 

Therefore, I built q. A simple, minimalistic, and fast
terminal tool that allows you to query LLMs from the terminal itself.

# What's Unique About This?

**It works on Linux, MacOS, and Windows out of the box.**

However, I am sure this is not a novel idea, or a task too hard to complete.
To be honest, I didn't even search if something like this existed.

I just wanted to learn something new and this seemed like the perfect 
problem for me to take.

# Architecture (why I made the choices i made)

I wanted to make this project not just for myself, but for others who might 
have the same problem as me. Now, for others to adapt it, I had to make sure
that the friction was as low as possible.

The best way was to make it a single binary that can be downloaded and run 
without downloading dependencies, setting up environments, etc.

Therefore, I chose Go for this project. It **compiles to a single binary**,
has good support for HTTP requests, and has libraries for almost everything like
spinners, terminal UIs, etc.

# Problems Faced

For the most part, it was smooth sailing. However, I did face some challenges:

- Learning Go, GoReleaser, Bash, and Powershell from scratch.
- Syntax and logical errors in the installation scripts.
- Improving latency and making some opinionated features.

# Learnings

Initially, this project started as a simple Bash script.
But, I quickly realised that Bash couldn't handle rendering spinners,
markdowns, etc.

Therefore, I decided to learn Go and build the project in it. Alongside,
I also learned **Bash and Powershell, GoReleaser**, and how to automate 
releases on GitHub.

# Future Vision

## Immediate Plans

- Add support for more providers and models.
- Add support for streaming responses.


## Long-term Plans

- Add support for interactive querying (going back and forth on the same topic).
- Add support for conversation history.
